What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a git repository is initialized, an empty hidden repository is created in the directory where the git init command was used. 
The directory can be viewed by using ls-a command that shows all files including the hidden ones. The files are hidden 
as git ensures that the files that are not needed to be seen can be kept hidden as a meta deta.

The initialization is important as we can cretae a project and put it in a git an d commit so that we can take advantage of git
