What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a git repository is initialized, an empty hidden repository is created in the directory where the git init command was used. 
The directory can be viewed by using ls-a command that shows all files including the hidden ones. The files are hidden 
as git ensures that the files that are not needed to be seen can be kept hidden as a meta deta.

The initialization is important as we can cretae a project and put it in a git an d commit so that we can take advantage of git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The satging area is a concept in git that allows us to decide which files are to be added in the git repository
The files are currrently plcaed in the working directory. The staging area is different from both working directory and repository
and alllows us to interface the repository with the currrent directory.
