When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository helps us share our code in an open platform. This way others can pull a request and can be granted permisson to modify it. This way we can collaborate with others to learn more. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If Git automatically stays up to date with all our commit, it will have all the commit that we make in remote. However, sometimes,I may not wish to pull the changes I made in remote to my local machine as I do not wish to add those commits at the moment in local. Hence, I would prefer manual pull.
